		<p4> As populations grow and industries expand, it is important to maintain sustainable, fair practices in order to accomodate for the workers and their families in these growing industries.As the global economy continues it's recovery from the recession of 2008-2009, we are seeing overall slower growth, exposed and increasing inequalities and a lack of jobs to accomodate the population surplus. In order to meet these expectations, the sustainability goal hopes to promote constant economic growth, higher levels of productivity as well as technological advancement. The UN has also made it its' mission to diversify, innovate and advance varrying industries in order to achieve job growth and increase GDP. In order to achieve this, the UN goal aims to :

		<center>
		</br>
		- Improve worker's condition in developing countries.
		</br>
		- Reduce the rate of illegal business practices such as child labour and worker exploitation.
		 </br>
		 - Help companies adapt fair trade practices for better worker conditions and compensation 
			</br>
		- Promoting policies that encourage entrepreneurship as well as business and job creation.
			</br>
		- Adapt green initiates and policies to reduce environmental strain.
			</br>
		- Help create and flourish opportunities for secure livelihoods in a multisectoral perspective.

	  <h1>Statistics and Introductory Information</h1>
</div>

<div class="content2">
	<p> Over the course of the last 25 years, the amount of workers living in extreme poverty has been dramatically decreased, causing the middle class of many countries to increase and even help decrease the income inequality present in many already developed countries.In fact, the middle class makes up to 34% of total employment, triple the growth seen from 1991-2015. However, populations are growing at such a rate that employment opportunities are unable to keep up; causing mass unemployment throughout the globe. The International Labour Organization states that there are over 178 million people were unemployed worldwide in 2018 - a rate of 5%. Even though we have exponentially decreased the amount of workers living in extreme proverty, there are still over 700 million workers worldwide living on under $3.20 a day. Slow industry expansion, poor work conditions and unfair wages trap many unfortunate enough all around the world; the overworked and underpaid employee is sadly a common theme throughout both developed and developing countries alike.

	  <h1> Continued Facts and Arguments</h1>
</div>

<div id='Sec3' class="content2">
	<p> The global divide of gender equality in the workplace is further apparent when looking at the labour force worldwide; over 85 million women are underutiziled compared to 55 million men. With these facts and statistics, it is painfully obvious we must repurpose and retool our social and economical policies aimed towards eradicating poverty; as it is clear that in too many places across the globe, having a stable job and income is not a certain ticket out of dire financial and living situations. Human trafficking, forced labour, exploitation of child workers, dangerous working conditions, job loss and industry monopilization, etc. - these are just some of the problems facing the completion of the goal. It is clear that the time to act is now, as populations have never grown at the same pace as they are in the past decade and the next following ones.

		<button class="accordion">What's the indicator used to show the economic growth of a country/industry? </button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>To show a country's economic growth, a measurement system known as GDP, (gross domestic product), was created by economists. Essentially, it displays the overall monetary value acquired from a country's manufacturing or services provided within a certain time period. In order to be an effective system to show growth, GDP is compared from the previous year's GDP. For example, if a country's yearly GDP has grown 5%, that means that the monetary value of all of it's industries and services has increased by 5% since last year.

		<button class="accordion">Why should someone in a developed, Western country, concern themselves with the economical/financial struggles of countries and industries in impoverished areas across the globe?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p> Technological advances across the world have connected people, businesses and nations alike. Free trade agreements,(allowing trade between countries with a reduction in tariffs and fees), have allowed developing countries to enter agreements with developed countries and gain a larger market outreach, enabling their industries to grow and prosper with suitable competition. Huge companies in the West often utilise cheap,unfair labour practices in countries such as China, Indonesia and Bangladesh; in which workers are often forced to work in terrible conditions for little to no pay. Thus, allowing companies to charge cheap prices from Western consumers to gain a large profit. Fueling this corporate machine by purchasing these cheap products and not concerning oneself with fair trade certification causes this vicious cycle of exploitation, allowing these companies to get richer while exploiting unknown workers halfway across the planet. It is a basic human right for every person to be treated equally, and yet many companies blatantly disregard this in order to turn a profit. </p>
