		<p4> As populations grow and industries expand, it is important to maintain sustainable, fair practices in order to accomodate for the workers and their families in these growing industries.As the global economy continues it's recovery from the recession of 2008-2009, we are seeing overall slower growth, exposed and increasing inequalities and a lack of jobs to accomodate the population surplus. In order to meet these expectations, the sustainability goal hopes to promote constant economic growth, higher levels of productivity as well as technological advancement. To achieve this, the UN goal aims to :

		<center>
		</br>
		- Improve worker's condition in developing countries.
		</br>
		- Reduce the rate of illegal business practices such as child labour and worker exploitation.
		 </br>
		 - Help companies adapt fair trade practices for better worker conditions and compensation 
			</br>
		- Promoting policies that encourage entrepreneurship as well as business and job creation.
			</br>
		- Adapt green initiates and policies to reduce environmental strain.
			</br>

	<p>Community urban gardens, green districts and sustainable communities that are now spreading like wildfire all over the world. Further examples of what is being done include; producingorganic products, using solar plants for hot water production and electricity, permaculture, green building, phytodepuration for water recycling is applied and where electric vehicles were introduced. Fortunately, for a few decades, civil society and public institutions have also started working on disaster risk management. Bio-engineering works to cope with  hydro-geological instability as an example, having the dual function of mitigating the landslides risk and oxygenating heavily polluted areas. As well as the resettlement of communities located in highly vulnerable areas through the construction of new facilities, designed for the adaptation to climate change and able to withstand tornadoes, earthquakes and floods, while totally respecting the residants' traditions.
