		<p>Our planet has provided us with an abundance of natural resources. But we have not utilized them responsibly and currently consume far beyond what our planet can provide. We must learn how to use and produce in sustainable ways that will reverse the harm that we have inflicted on the planet.

		</br>
		</br>

		Achieving economic growth and sustainable development requires that we urgently reduce our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Agriculture is the biggest user of water worldwide, and irrigation now claims close to 70 percent of all freshwater for human use.

		The efficient management of our shared natural resources, and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants, are important targets to achieve this goal. Encouraging industries, businesses and consumers to recycle and reduce waste is equally important, as is supporting developing countries to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption by 2030.

		A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs.  Halving the per capita of global food waste at the retailer and consumer levels is also important for creating more efficient production and supply chains. This can help with food security, and shift us towards a more resource efficient economy.

<div id='FAQh' class="header4">
	  <h1>Stats & More Information</h1>
</div>

<div class="content2" style="height:200px;">
	<p> There are many aspects of consumption that with simple changes can have a big impact on society as a whole. For example, each year about one third of all food produced (equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes worth around $1 trillion) ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices, something that businesses need to address. 
		
	</br>
	</br>

	When it comes to consumers, households consume 29 per cent of global energy and contribute to 21 per cent of resultant CO2 emissions. However, if people worldwide switched to energy efficient lightbulbs the world would save US$120 billion annually. Water pollution is also a pressing issue that needs a sustainable solution. We are polluting water faster than nature can recycle and purify water in rivers and lakes.</p>

<div id='Sec3' class="content2" style="height:200px;">
	<p>Some Statistics Concerning Responsible Consumption & Production;
	</br>
	</br>

	- 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted every year, while almost 2 billion people go hungry or undernourished.
	</br>

	- The food sector accounts for around 22 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions, largely from the conversion of forests into farmland.
	</br>

	- Globally, 2 billion people are overweight or obese.
	</br>

	- Only 3 percent of the world’s water is fresh (drinkable), and humans are using it faster than nature can replenish it.
	</br>

	- If people everywhere switched to energy efficient lightbulbs, the world would save US$120 billion annually.
	</br>

	- One-fifth of the world's final energy consumption in 2013 was from renewable sources.

<div class="wrapper2">

	<div class="section1">
		<button class="accordion">How can I help as a consumer?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>Being thoughtful about what you buy and choosing a sustainable option whenever possible. This includes things from ensuring you don’t throw away food, to reducing your consumption of plastic. On an everyday basis you can carry a reusable bag with you as well refuse to use plastic straws and recycling plastic bottles.</p>
			</div>

		<button class="accordion">Why Is This Goal Important?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>This goal is extremely important because cities and the world in general is consuming more natural resources and producing more waste than is possible for the planet to remain healthy. To add on, demand for already constrained natural resources is rising and if we don’t act to change our consumption and production patterns now, we will cause irreversible damage to our environment.</p>

	<div class = "section2">

	<button class="accordion">What's being done?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>In Sweden, their greenhuse gas emmissones decreased by 14 per cent between 2008 and 2014. Also their Government has adopted an action plan for a toxic-free everyday environment. In June 2016, their Government presented a national procurement strategy that includes rules for environmental public procurement and how this is to contribute to social sustainability. As you can see, some countries are doing their part in moving towards achieving goal 12.</p>
