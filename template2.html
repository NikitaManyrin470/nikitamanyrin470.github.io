		<p4> Fossil fuels have been one of the main causes of the rise of global temperatures as well as the increase in air pollution, destruction of animal habitats and overall harm to the environment; they are also expensive products and can often destabilize industries.. However, after the successful implementation of cleaner, more sustainable forms of energy, we will be able to reduce future economic, environmental and social costs. These strengths can also help with the reduction of poverty and further strengthen economic competitiveness. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Sustainable production and consumption's philosophy is to "do more with less", which means it will effectively cut resource costs while also increasing net welfare gains from various economic industries and activities. The initiative will also include campaigns meant to raise awareness and educate people about the benefits of sustainability production and consumption.

<div class="content2">
	<p> It is projected that if the planet was to continue our dependence of resources by 2050, then we would require the natural materials of up to 3 planets to consistently maintain it. The implementation of sustainable initiatives is more vital for the future planet than ever before. Only 3% of the earth's water supply is fresh, (drinkable), and humans are draining it faster than it can replenish. Past generations have neglected the natural resources provided by the planet and we continue to follow in these same footsteps, as we keep deforestating massive chunks of vast ecosystems in order to accomodate for our growing need for farms. There are almost 2 billion undernourished people across the globe, and yet we discard almost 1.3 billion tonnes of perfectly adequate food.

	<p> - By 2030, achieve efficient and sustainable management of natural resources.
	<br> 
	  	- By 2030, reduce waste generated by practicing prevention, recycling, reduction and reusal. 
	<br>
		- Encourage transnational companies to adapt sustainable business practices. 
	<br>
		- Assist developing countries with technological and economic research in order to help adapt sustainable patterns of production and consumption
	<br>
		- By 2030, cut food-generated waste in half by implementing frameworks and key strategies for reduction.
	<br>
		- Implement a flexible 10 year framework on sustainable production practices to act as a guideline for manufacturers.
