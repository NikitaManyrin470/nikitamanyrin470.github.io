		<p>On this page the connections between goal 11, Sustainable Cities & Communities, and goal 12, Resposncible Consumption & Production, will be discussed as well as how we can help to reach both these goals. Firstly, when people think of sustainable cities they think of an ecologically friendly city where consumption of electricity, water, and production of waste are minimized. Already we can see the intertwine meant of these two goals, as you can't have a sustainable city or commmunity without being responsible about what they consume and produce. Cities can't be sustainable if they are producing tons of waste as and using excessive amounts of natural resources such as water and natural gas powered buildings. Furthermore, as stated previously, sustainable cities are very ecologically friendly, this means that if the city is again producing tons of waste, it can only put it in a landfill or use some other way of disposing of it (usually incineration). These landfills and the fumes produced when the waste is burned are terrible for the environment, which would make that city not sustainable as it is harming the planet.</p>

	<h1>More Stats</h1>
</div>


<div class="content2" style="height:380px;">
	<p>
	- Cities are big resource consumers. Occupying just 3% of the world’s surface, they consume some 75% of its resources, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. They also generate 50% to 80% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and half of global waste.
	</br>
	</br>

	- In 2013 1/5, or 20%, of the worlds energy consumption was from renewable resources, this is amazing because this shows the progress we have made so far.
	</br>
	</br>

	- One surprising city leading the way in the reduction of Co2 emissions, is Shenzhen, China, where in December 2013 a new fleet of more than 6,000 units of eco-friendly vehicles were introduced, becoming the largest zero emissions service fleet in the world.
	</br>
	</br>

	- San Francisco has implemented an 11-year-old zero waste program, which now sees 80% of all trash diverted from landfills. By 2020, the city hopes to bring that up to 100%. This is another great example of the steps citys, states, and countries are taking towards becoming more sustainable by being responsible with what they consume and produce.
	</br>
	</br>

	- Advances in plastic materials and polymer processing techniques enable a type of precision horticulture impossible either at scale or in an economically viable way with metal, glass and ceramics or by using the original methods from antiquity with perforated clay pipes. This means plastic that would have gone to waste can now be recycled and put back into the economy with little waste produced.
